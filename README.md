# System Configuration
This is the main system configuration for all of my machines! I use:
- nixos
- i3wm (when on x11)
- hyprland (when on wayland)
- neovim

Feel free to poke around and take what you need! Everything is fairly well organized.

The core flake.nix has many different configurations for my different machines.
